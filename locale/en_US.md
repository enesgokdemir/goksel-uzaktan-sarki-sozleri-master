Why, why did you go? Maybe we could be happy together
Did I frighten you, how could I hurt you?

I had to get to know you, try to learn who you are
I had to know what was at the end of this road
I had to understand, had to know who you are
This story just needed an end

How could you make me stuck on you
from such a distance
without even talking
You just came and then disappeared
mystirious and haughty, thats how you got in my mind

Whats your secret, your thoughts,
you left me behind, who are you
Disappear like a dust so I can end my sorrow
Let my mind defeat my love for you

I had to get to know you, try to learn who you are
I had to know what was at the end of this road
I had to understand, to know who you are
I had to find the words to say goodbye to you
